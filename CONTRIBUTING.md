# Contributing to the Aionian Project

Thank you for your interest in adding your contributions to this project.

Before you begin:
- Go through the Code of Conduct.
- Check out existing issues.

If you feel that there is some issue that isn't already raised, feel free to issue it.

During contribution to code

- Please refrain from changing the data structures (Except the `CrossReferenceDatabase`, since that is still unused by the Core Application), as a lot of parsing depends upon the current structure.
- Ensure that your added feature/change is tested in the XUnit testing project within the repository 
- Describe your changes clearly while creating the Pull Request.
- Be polite and respectful during discussions
